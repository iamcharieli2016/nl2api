Converting Natural Language to API Calls

```
Converting natural language into API calls is an interesting and challenging task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. This project typically involves several key steps:

Understanding and Parsing the Natural Language Request: Recognizing the userâ€™s intent and relevant information.
Mapping the Intent to API Operations: Translating the recognized intent into actual API calls.
Constructing the API Request: Building the correct API request based on the parsed data.
Executing the API Call and Returning the Result: Interacting with the backend system via APIs and returning the result.
```
